                    Hey there! I'm Dominique Lucien, SouthWest Florida resident and Software Engineering student. My passion for learning means that I 
                    am always exploring new technologies, collaborating on projects and problem solving.
                    I work in C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript with experience presenting to small groups of 16 members,
                    event organization and working in teams. Thanks for visiting my portfolio and you can reach out to me below!

                    This AVR Assembly code project contains interrupts, timers, meticulous commenting all supporting a physical simple simon game. The arduino wiring was a challenge and although we couldn't succesfully
                    play through a game sequence we did learn a lot about collaborating on github, debugging and conflict resolution. With the team all trying different wiring configuration and so much debate over what the most efficient 
                    design we all had to develop great communication skills if we wanted to complete our prototype and presentiong by the deadline. Overall, a great learning experince and lots of fun.

                    I recently completed Johns Hopkins University's course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers, 
                    where I gained valuable skills in web development. Using my knowledge of Twitter Bootstrap, I built this website, 
                    which was an exciting opportunity to apply what I learned. This self-paced learning experience was incredibly 
                    insightful, and I am eager to continue my studies, particularly in JavaScript and React, to further enhance my 
                    development skills.

                    The Hotel Management System facilitates the hotel room booking process through making a reservation, accessing information on reserved or unreserved rooms and outputting information detailing the amenities offered by the rooms.
                    Offered me the challenge of working with object-oriented programming concepts and layers of conditional statements.

                    Boom Box has a mission that resonates deeply with my own story. Growing up in a home with music being a center piece
                    of life, I know how a good song at just the right time can truly bring people together. The app is a 
                    social solution to the challenges of finding and connecting with like minded people. Working in a Full Stack Development role with minor operations responsibilites, I have 
                     collaborated with leadership to deliver a 6-week prototype sprint schedule and presented it to 8 team members,
                     developed social media post and register APIs using Express.js, wrote and optimized basic PostgreSQL queries 
                     for retrieving and deleting data from the database and researched and evaluated React components and libraries, including Tamagui and WithFrame, to inform development decisions.
